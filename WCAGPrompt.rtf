"Act as a Senior Full-Stack Developer specialized in digital accessibility. Create a fully functional web page that will be the  front end user interface for a WCAG website scanner using Node.js, Javascript, Puppeteer, and the axe-core engine.\
Core Requirements:\
URL Input: The tool must accept a target URL via command line or a simple web interface.\
Automated Scanning: Use a browser to enter in the web site information that is to be scanned, navigate to the URL, and inject axe-core to perform a comprehensive audit against WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.\
Detailed Reporting: Generate a structured report ( HTML) that includes:\
Issue Overview: Number of total issues and severity levels (Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor).\
Element Analysis: Specific HTML snippets that failed, their CSS selectors, and the impact on users.\
Remediation Guidance: Clear descriptions of why each element failed and actionable steps to fix them based on WCAG success criteria.\
Key Categories: Ensure the scanner specifically checks for:\
Color Contrast: Text-to-background ratios.\
Images: Missing or non-descriptive alt text.\
Keyboard Accessibility: Focus indicators and tab order issues.\
Semantic HTML: Proper heading levels and ARIA landmark usage.\
Output: Provide the complete package.json configuration and an index.html file to run the scanner. Provide a web page report with the number of tests ran and passed along with any problems discovered. }
